# Roadmap — Agentic SDLC Kit

> **This file carries no implementation authority.** Agents implement only from an
> approved `specs/NNN-name/spec.md`; this roadmap only says what to spec next. A roadmap
> row is never a requirement — if an agent is asked to implement from this file, it must
> stop and ask for a spec (constitution I).

The kit is its own project: its "screens" are capability gaps and field lessons from
adoptions. The inventory below is regenerated from the field-feedback log and adoption
session findings; the roadmap is authored and never regenerated.

## Inventory *(generated — regenerate freely)*

**Generated from**: adoption flow-back session findings (2026-09-01), feature 003 AI
reviews, adoption field-lesson candidates (expense-tracker, flowboard)
**Generated on**: 2026-09-01 — **by**: manual audit during the kit 0.3.0/0.4.0 flow-back

| Inv # | Gap / lesson | Source |
|---|---|---|
| GAP-001 | No defined mechanism for adopted projects to receive kit updates — the 0.3.0/0.4.0 flow-back was manual surgery (hand-classifying kit-owned vs project-instantiated files, hand-applied constitution amendments, citation sweeps) | 2026-09-01 flow-back session |
| GAP-002 | `scripts/enforcement-pack.ps1` not named in the constitution's template-sync list, though it encodes constitutional constants (batch cap, cooling-off hours) | 003 phase 4 AI review, finding F3 |
| GAP-003 | Adoption traps live only in session memory, not kit docs: create-next-app `.env*` gitignore swallows `.env.example`; create-next-app skips `git init` inside an existing repo tree; pre-existing database behind a reused connection string (the `Spc` incident); `--warnaserror` vs vulnerable transitive template deps; raw imported docs break doc-lint | expense-tracker 001/002, flowboard scaffolds |
| GAP-004 | Pipelining WIP conditions ("review formally requested") are socially checked; no machine check counts a developer's open `NNN-*` branches | 003 phase 3 AI review, finding F1 |
| GAP-005 | The batch-size cap (3) lives in two places — constitution X and `$Config.MaxBatchPhases` — kept in sync only by amendment discipline | 003 phase 4 AI review, finding F3 |

## Roadmap *(authored — humans only, never regenerated)*

Status flow: `idea → specified → in progress → shipped → dropped`

| Feature | Covers (Inv #) | Priority | Status | Owner | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Delivery-core amendment | — | P1 | shipped | anas.m | `specs/001-delivery-core-amendment/` |
| Enforcement pack | — | P1 | shipped | anas.m | `specs/002-enforcement-pack/` |
| Flow-efficiency pack | — | P1 | shipped | anas.m | `specs/003-flow-efficiency-pack/` |
| Kit-update channel (manifest of kit-owned vs slot-bearing files; update script that copies the verbatim set and reports the surgical set; amendment flow-down guidance) | GAP-001 | P1 | idea | anas.m | — |
| Field-lesson harvest (encode the adoption traps into `adoption/` steps and rulebook templates) | GAP-003 | P2 | idea | — | — |
| Pipelining WIP machine check (enforcement-pack counts a developer's open `NNN-*` branches) | GAP-004 | P3 | idea | — | — |

## Decisions log *(authored)*

- 2026-09-01 GAP-002 fixed directly on the `docs/kit-roadmap-and-sync-list` branch
  (constitution 0.4.1 PATCH — sync-list addition, no rule change), not promoted to a
  feature: one line of governance bookkeeping.
- 2026-09-01 GAP-005 accepted as-is: the constitution's sync list (after the GAP-002 fix)
  now names the enforcement pack, which is the mechanism that keeps the two locations
  aligned on future amendments. No further work planned.
- 2026-09-01 GAP-004 deliberately deferred until field use shows actual pipelining abuse
  (003 phase 3 review, F1) — encoding enforcement for a problem not yet observed is
  ceremony.
