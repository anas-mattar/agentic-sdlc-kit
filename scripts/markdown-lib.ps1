.SYNOPSIS
    How Markdown renders a comment marker: shared by every kit script that reads a document.

.DESCRIPTION
    Feature 014 learned this the expensive way. A '<!--' inside a fenced block or an inline
    code span is LITERAL TEXT, not a comment opener, and a check that misses the distinction
    reads a document nobody can see: 014's B7 truncated tasks.md from the line that quoted the
    syntax onward, hiding every approver record after it, and its first fix (a '(?s)```.*?```'
    sweep over the whole blob) re-paired fence runs across line starts and put a REAL comment
    inside a region the check called code — H1, reopened by its own fix.

    Feature 015 found the same blindness a third time, in build-digests.ps1 (GAP-025): one
    backticked '<!--' in prose opened a phantom comment that swallowed every digest marker
    after it, so the generator wrote a digest missing real rules and reported OK.

    Feature 016 found the fix for both was per-line (GAP-028): a code span that wrapped onto
    the next line of its paragraph looked like an unpaired backtick, so its '<!--' stayed
    armed and hid everything after it, in both consumers. Three review rounds then showed
    that every reading which disarms more than per-line pairing lets the amendment check
    count some hidden record as a grant: pairing spans across lines misreads backticks, and
    even disarming an opener that is not a comment reveals text hidden by an attribute or a
    title. So the fix is the digest generator's alone (016 D11). Spans are still paired one
    line at a time everywhere (Convert-SpanText, which the amendment check uses as it is),
    and the generator also disarms an opener its model finds cannot open a comment
    (Convert-CodeSpanMarkers says exactly when). In the amendment check GAP-028 stays, on
    purpose, fail-closed. Still not modelled: a '-->' inside a span that wraps, and a '<!--'
    opened mid-line in prose that runs on into later lines. That is the comment model's
    business; 016's phase 2 is scoped to make build-digests report a marker it passes over
    inside one.

    Three of these functions were enforcement-pack.ps1's. They live here because the next
    script to read a Markdown document should not be the fourth to learn it. Same reason
    scripts/scope-lib.ps1 exists for the two scope graders: one implementation cannot drift
    from itself.

# an unrecognised span leaves its markers armed, which HIDES text rather than revealing it —

# The DIGEST generator's reading of a whole document (016 D1, D10, D11): the per-line span
# pairing every line had before 016 (Convert-SpanText), plus one change. A '<!--' that result
# left armed is disarmed when the model below finds no way for it to open a comment. Returns
# the same number of lines, each the same length as its input, so a caller may index the
# result by line and take substrings of it by the raw line's offsets.
#
# The amendment-authority check does NOT use this: it keeps per-line Convert-SpanText (016
# D11). Three review rounds found that every reading which disarms more than per-line pairing
# let some record in a real comment, or hidden by a tag attribute or link title, count as a
# grant. Here the stakes are a digest line, and an opener this rule disarms wrongly costs at
# most a harvested marker the source never showed.
#
# An opener is disarmed when it sits inline and no '-->' follows it, in the raw text, before
# the next blank line: an inline comment cannot cross a blank line. That is GAP-028's wrapped
# span, whose quoted opener has no closer in its paragraph. What the model counts:
#   - Blank: a line of spaces and tabs only, as CommonMark reads it. A no-break space or a
#     form feed is content, so a comment runs on through it (016 round-3 review F1).
#   - Not inline: a fenced line, and a line inside a raw HTML block. A block is found on the
#     raw text after any list or block-quote markers and runs to its CommonMark end: a pre,
#     script, style or textarea block to its closing tag, a comment to its closer, a
#     processing instruction to '?>', a declaration to '>', CDATA to ']]>', any other tag to a
#     blank line. Raw HTML passes through to the browser, where a comment does cross a blank
#     line. A start of a block with one of the longer ends is honoured even inside a block
#     that ends at a blank line, and the enclosing block resumes when it closes (round-3 and
#     round-4 review F1). Every block start is read on fenced lines too, for the fence map
#     misreads some fences. A tag line that opens a pre, script, style or textarea element
#     later on the line takes that element's end. Ends are read after the container markers.
#     These are the shapes the reviews found and the cases guard; containers are otherwise
#     not modelled (a container that closes does not end a block here), which keeps more
#     lines on the per-line result, never fewer.
# Not modelled, and left on the per-line result: a code span that wraps is not recognised, so
# a '-->' inside one stays armed, and so does the '<!--' of one whose paragraph holds a '-->'
# later. Constructs other than comments that hide text (attributes, titles) are not modelled
# at all; a marker inside one may be harvested.
