# Specification Quality Checklist: Flow-Efficiency Pack

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
- [x] `Delivery Level` header is filled with one of Lite, Standard, or Critical
  (`docs/sdlc/critical-delivery.md`) — not left as a placeholder

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain — both resolved by the user 2026-09-01
  (FR-007: finish current phase, then return; FR-008: batch cap of 3 phases)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. The two law-loosening decisions (pipelining resolution order,
  batch-size cap) were made explicitly by the user, not defaulted. Spec is ready for
  `/speckit.plan`.
